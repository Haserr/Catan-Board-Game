This is a new project I am staring in the light of graduation. 
I will be trying to work on this regularly.

This is an attempt to re create a board game called The Settelers of Catan.
I will be making the game using the pygame engine.
So far, the current progress on the game is simply just setting up the game board.

Currently working on allowing a user to place objects on the board and keep track of what tiles the objects were placed on.
